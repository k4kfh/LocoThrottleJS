BUNDLES LIST:
You can store all your bundles files in /cfg/bundles. All you need to do here is add the filenames so that ZephyrCab knows where to find them.

EXAMPLE: If you have the files CBQ2.zephyrcab and SW1000.zephyrcab, you should do this:

bundles.files = [
    "CBQ2.zephyrcab",
    "SW1000.zephyrcab",
]
*/
bundles.files = [
    "CBQ2.zephyrcab",
