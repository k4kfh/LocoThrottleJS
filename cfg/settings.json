ZEPHYRCAB CONFIGURATION

This file is used to store settings server-side. This is capable of storing an IP address to connect to automatically, as well as other things.

/*
CONNECTION SETTINGS
By default, these settings  assume that ZephyrCab is running on a local JMRI instance, via the built-in Jetty web server, and ignores the cfg.ip/cfg.port settings. This is the recommended method.

If you'd prefer to use an external web server, set cfg.webServer to "external" and cfg.ip/cfg.port to your JMRI PC's IP and port. This is not recommended except for experienced users/developers.
