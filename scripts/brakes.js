        Algebra behind this function:
        Since a brake reservoir is 2.5 times the size of a brake cylinder, we can set up a problem to find the equalization pressure like this (for a 90psi brake pipe):
        
        90 - x  = 2.5x
        
        This can be rearranged to:
        
        90 = 3.5x
        
        x is the full service brake REDUCTION. To find the equalizing pressure, subtract x from the pipe pressure. So for this,
        
        x = 26
        
        90 - 26 = 64psi
        
        So for a 90psi brake pipe, you can only make up to a 26psi reduction. At that reduction, the brake pipe pressure, reservoir pressure, and cylinder pressure equalize, so you can't move any more air without releasing the brakes.
        
        This function is a programming implementation of that same math.
