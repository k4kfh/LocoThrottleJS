/*
JMRI CORE

This file contains what amounts to a scratchbuilt JMRI interface. I opted to build my own interface for greater flexibility than using the provided JMRI jQuery plugin, which at the time of this file's creation I did not know about.

This is not the lowest level portion of the interface, however. websockets.js contains most of the direct interface, and handles things like the layout connection initiation/termination. This file does not deal directly with the network; it is responsible for relaying info between the rest of ZephyrCab and the JMRI JSON servlet.

you can call this with keyword new to create a new throttle object that has all the functions of a working throttle. no decoder-specific anything, just like it would be on a Digitrax throttle or something

example: exampleThrottle = new jmri.throttle(1379, 0)
now I can run exampleThrottle.f.set(0, true) to turn on #1379's headlight. You get the idea.

This function should not be used by anything except the core train builder stuff; if you try and build your own throttle stuff using this it WILL BREAK THINGS!
