## Models

_Not applicable; the scale speed feature is not finished yet!_

## Prototypes

Please use the list below to see if your prototype locomotive is supported by ZephyrCab. Each locomotive is rated on the following scale:

- <p style="color:green">Good</p> means the locomotive bundle is well-tested and stable.
- <p style="color:orange">Fair</p> means the locomotive bundle is basically functional, but may have minor code issues or inaccurate information.
- <p style="color:red">Bad</p> means the locomotive bundle is very buggy, and is likely still under development. It is available, but it is unstable and/or unfinished, and probably contains inaccurate information or lacks information. Bundles with a <p style="color:red">Bad</p> rating are recommended for developers only.
- <p style="color:grey">Unrated</p> means the locomotive bundle has been developed or is being developed, but we don't know how stable it is and what bugs it may contain.
