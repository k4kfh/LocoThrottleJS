## What is ZephyrCab?

ZephyrCab combines a train simulator physics engine with [JMRI](jmri.org), making your model locomotives handle just like the real thing. You get an 8-position notched throttle, a painstakingly accurate Westinghouse brake system, wheel slip, and ultra-realistic acceleration.

## Compatiblity

Any JMRI-connected layout will work with ZephyrCab.

_Any_ DCC decoder is supported. More extensive support is available for certain sound decoders, offering greater realism.
